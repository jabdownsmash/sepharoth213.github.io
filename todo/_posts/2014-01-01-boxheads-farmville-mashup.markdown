####Coming from Mr. 'Games are being irrespected as an art form' sure.

Yeah yeah. At some point I'm going to have to make myself marketable, and I'm going to have to make a cash cow. A game like Boxheads is a perfect way to just get my foot into the flash game industry, and I have a bunch of ideas on how to make my entry be unique and just really, really fun.
