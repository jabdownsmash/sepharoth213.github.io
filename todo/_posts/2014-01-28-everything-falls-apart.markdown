####What's wrong with it?

Well, it's not quite complete. Title Screen utilizes a lot of empty space as part of its metaphor, but it comes off as an unfinished product. Additionally, Title Screen was made under a heavy time limitation, and I want to reapproach the project with more care and without trying to make emptiness a core part of the background.

Which means I'll have to actually do a lot of art for it.
