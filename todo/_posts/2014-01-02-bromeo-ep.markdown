####What kind of musical experiences?

I wanted to combine the idea of episodic releases with the traditional EP release system the music industry has had for decades and release a bunch of games under the same 'EP,' which all would be focused on a single song.

The entire project was inspired by [Keyboard Drumset Fucking Werewolf](http://cactusquid.blogspot.com/2011/10/keyboard-drumset-fucking-werewolf.html) -- which is still my favorite Cactus game, much more so than Hotline Miami -- and [Kevin's game](http://kevinleutzinger.com/game). You have to get past the 30 second mark to understand why Kevin's game is worth playing, but it's pretty difficult. I'd suggest giving up after that point.
