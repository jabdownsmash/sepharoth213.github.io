####What's Sequence?

[Sequence](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200910/) is a rhythm-step game turned RPG with a brilliant multi-track system to manage defense, offense, and resource management. I think the game falls flat in a couple ways though, namely the lack of dynamism in the battles. Controlling battles via rhythm-step is a wonderful concept, but having it be so needlessly repetitive and stat based is annoying.

Once I solve the problem of finding a way to reproduce the feeling of mobility and choice within an engine like this, this project will be under way.
