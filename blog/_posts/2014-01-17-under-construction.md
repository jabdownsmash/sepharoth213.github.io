First blog post, hoorah.

####Why a website?

I figured it would be cool to have a web portfolio, and then had the idea to also have a web todo list. I figured if I were to have a todo list to reference whenever I wanted to get to work on some project, I might as well have it public. People can already mostly see how much work I've been doing by looking at my GitHub, but now there's a way for them (and myself) to see that kind of progress at a more intimate level.

####Sure, but reviews and blogging?

Why not? I have enough thoughts to at least write them down, even though I hate the idea of wanting people to read it, it's at least a journal.  
But having a seperate section for reviews is something that I've wanted to do for a while: if I'm going to do video games for a living I might as well try to develop my own set of concrete opinions and personal theory. How much I hated Offspring Fling and having to play it to earn its Steam trading cards was what really pushed me into the whole website thing.

####Well, it doesn't look like much yet...

Yeah I know, there's lot of placeholder-esque stuff, but once this blog post is up, it's all technically valid content. It'll be fleshed out over the next few whatever as I feel like working on it.
