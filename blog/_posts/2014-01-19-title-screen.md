I just released Title Screen on [Kongregate](http://kongregate.com/games/aaronsantiago/title-screen)!
Before you play it, I felt that I should explain a bit about what the game is about. The short version of this essay I'm about to write is: Freud, communcation, and relationships. If you care more about my thoughts, keep reading. At least read the next 3 paragraphs.

####The Theory

I took a psychoanalysis class last semester, and it really messed me up. The whole thing about unconscious impulses and libido and all of the classifications of defense mechanisms and theoretical examples of activity that exemplified the psychoanalytical process revealed a lot of stuff about my past that I didn't really know what to do with.  

But besides that, something in the theory that really clicked with me was the idea of language as an obfuscation of libidinal desires, as a 'castration.' I loved the idea that language's limitations and syntax forced the human mind to 'mature' in a way that brought us further from our 'selves', because to me that meant that there was a spectrum: some languages would bring you further away than others. I also thought that you could extract a higher baseline empathy in communication simply by increasing vocabulary, noting [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/) as a strong example of language that is much stronger at delivering the 'id' than English could be.

####Communication is the key

Regardless of my reasons, the thought of being able to 'communicate' things better or worse based on how close the content was to your id's impulses sounded a lot like how art worked, so I set out to create a game that would try to force the player to experience what I experienced with my psychoanalytic revelations. While the game is mostly empty and unpolished, there's plenty of metaphor that tries to attack the player directly rather than showing them symbols.

####The actual story is about relationships though

The part that was important was making sure that the story I was trying to tell was as real and personal as possible: otherwise it wouldn't work at all. There's no point in trying to deliver my thoughts and feelings if I made them all up.

Though I couldn't tell the story directly, I didn't want to share the narrative as it happened since there would be too much and I probably wouldn't remember enough to make it make any sense. Instead, I went for the core ideas that constructed what I thought, and mixed it in with imagery that I had floating around in my head.

By the way, before you read on, you should play the game first. It will take less than five minutes and I don't want to spoil things.

####This part mattered to me the most

While making the game, and before it, there were a few images that very strongly wanted to be a part of the game. Going along with the 'id is art' theme, I made sure that I built the game around these images.

The first was the title screen itself, a blank background with large, pixellated text. Then there was the final scene, of the man staring himself in the mirror crying and his reflection bleeding from his heart. The scene where you collect hearts flying in from the right was important as well. Lastly there was the first few screens, where the player walks across a blank page and the first girl appears, bringing the world with her.

In the end, I came up with metaphor and reasoning for each of these moments, but mostly to tie them together as a cohesive unit.

####Breaking it down

There are a few metaphors that really engross the entire experience. The first is the 'world' that the game presents the player. When the game starts, there is nothing in the world at all, but as it progresses it becomes more of a setting, though it quickly becomes more surreal at the same time, with the hole in the wall and the being swept up into the air.

Mechanically speaking, it was key that I gave the player as few options as possible. They can't move left, only look back, and I made sure that the animations couldn't be abused to break the idea that the player's avatar is an acting unit in the world. If you play around with looking back and moving forward, you'll notice that the controls aren't very responsive in that regards, and I think I did a good job with that.

However, the game is very visually lacking, and that is my fault. I'm no artist, but with all of the empty space, I could really drive home the idea that the white is your space, and the lines are the invasion that the women bring into the narrative.

One of my favorite moments in the game is the brief moment you spend in front of a door and a window. There is a hint of an outside world, one outside of the white space you were originally in, and possibly an option to leave this girl completely. Regardless of the player's intent, they can't move into the door. The little man won't even look at it.

Another main metaphor is the flashing that happens to the girls and to the reflection at the end. This is my attempt to show my understanding of the narcissistic object to the player: each girl flashes a hint of 'it' more and more until you see that you also have 'it', or maybe you are 'it'. Regardless, upon seeing his reflection and the flashing, the avatar breaks down into tears without the prompt of the player.

Control itself is where all of the more minor metaphors show up. The player is unable to get off of this track that they put themselves on by moving past the first screen, ever. They have a bit of influence on the pacing for a little while, but for the most part the only direction is forward.

Eventually I'll revisit Title Screen as 'Everything Falls Apart' and try to make it more presentable visually and interesting gameplay-wise, but for now this is what I've got.
