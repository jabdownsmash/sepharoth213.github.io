I put Chromacobra on [Kongregate](http://kongregate.com/games/aaronsantiago/chromacobra). It's not really my game, since the whole thing was Kevin's idea, but there it is.

####Did he make the music too?

No, but I got the music from some random guy who posted on /r/gamedevclassifieds and he was impossible to work with. That along with the whole HaxePunk crumpling under the weight of how I implemented ChromaCobra made me stop caring about it.

Play it though, it's a pretty fun diversion for a couple minutes.
