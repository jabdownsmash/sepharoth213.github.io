I played Offspring Fling for about 2 hours, only because I wanted to get the rest of the Steam cards I needed for it. I dreaded those two hours because I knew why I never earned all of those cards in the first place.

Offspring Fling is a really bad game.

####The Amazingly Compelling Story

When you started up, you're greeted with the cheery Offspring Fling music and the wonderfully done Offspring Fling art style. There's a nice slideshow that is the entirety of the exposition in Offspring Fling: you're the mother of a bunch of baby whatever-you-ares and a big, bad dinosaur looking thing scared them all away into hiding. Now you have to go find them all.

I mean, sure, I'm not supposed to pay much attention to the story in a game like this, but when the entire game is trying to ride off of the charm of the protagonist and her adorable children, you'd think that there would be something that would make me care about them.

But instead, the little babies sit like rocks, waiting for their heroic mother to come and get them. The same dinosaur that scared them away they now allow to not only approach but chomp away at the helpless little babies. Now that's not right at all.

The rocks metaphor goes even further, though: a bit into the game, Offspring Fling introduces actual rocks that, amazingly, have the exact same properties as the babies: weight, size, ability to be thrown at enemies to stun them. You know, why didn't she just chuck one of her babies at the one dinosaur that scared all the hundreds of them away? She has to deal with a lot more than one dinosaur now.

Then there's the whole magic door thing and the fact that the babies are in precarious and impossible to reach places.

####The actual issue with Offspring Fling

Babies or rocks, if the game had shipped with a more engaging storyline, I don't think i would have cared. The real problem is the level design.

Every level is like a single gimmick built into a little frame the size of the screen, or sometimes a frame a little bit bigger than the screen. There's the wonderfully clever level built off of the fact that two offsprings can fit on one game tile entitled 'Room for Two' for example. This would be fine if that wasn't how every level went. I'd say 80% to 90% of the levels are solvable by a single glance, and it just becomes a chore to go through them all.

The platforming bits aren't really very interesting either. There are just jumps that you have to make to solve the puzzles, and really annoying things you have to do if you want to beat the dev times. There's no jump buffer for pressing the jump button before you hit the ground and it's one of the more incredibly annoying things I've ever had to deal with.

So what happens when a puzzle platformer takes the worst of both puzzling and platforming? This game. If you were thinking of spending money on Offspring Fling, don't. Just go play Yoshi's Island instead. It's a much more exciting puzzle action platformer with more adorable graphics, better cheery music, a storyline that is both plausible and actually makes you care about baby Mario, and above all, much, much better gameplay.
