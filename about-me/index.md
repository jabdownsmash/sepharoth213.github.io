I'm Aaron Santiago, currently an 18 year old student attending Bard College at Simon's Rock. I'm 5'3", 115 lbs, and have a passion for video game design and theory.

####video games, eh?

Yeah, but in terms of video games I play my time is dominated by League of Legends, Super Smash Brothers Melee, and Dota 2, though Magicka: Wizard Wars is something of beauty.  
I have been persuaded into hailing Melee as the best video game ever made, and I can't really argue very well against that notion.

####where's the resume-esque stuff i asked for?

I dropped out of high school after 10th grade to get to Simon's Rock, a decision I have never regretted. I worked for a little while as a 'Computer Assistant' on campus, which is as nondescript as it sounds.  
Both summer 2012 and 2013 I had an internship in Indianapolis with a pharmaceutical company named Quintiles, where I held the wonderfully important-sounding position 'Associate Software Engineer'. They had me make some stuff for them, but most importantly I picked up a lot of C# and SQL knowledge from those excursions.  
My expected graduation is in Spring 2015, when I'll graduate with a Bachelor's in computer science.

####what else do you do?

I'm an avid programmer, working in whatever language I feel like. I recently got into web development, and that's why this website exists. I used to be a percussionist, or more specifically a marimbist for the drumline in Avon back in high school, where I won two national champion titles along with my [marching band](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=avon+marching+2009).
