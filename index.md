This is where I keep my internet persona, available now for robot crawling and human viewing. Here I'll blog about stuff I'm working on or thoughts I have.

Behind the to do list button you'll find a list of project ideas and works in progress, along with descriptions, thoughts, etc.

The what I've done page holds a portfolio of things I've created.

If you are looking for more resume-esque type stuff, if you want to get a hold of me, or if you are interested in me as a person, there's the about me page.

Lastly, if you're confused about all of this, hit the triangle up at the top, next to welcome. It'll all make sense then.
