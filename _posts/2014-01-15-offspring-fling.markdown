##Wow.

I'm going to be honest, this game is awful. Like, really just ugh.

###Alright, fine, why?

There are multiple points of contention here, let's do a nice little breakdown.

####The Concept

Offspring Fling has a pretty simple concept: you're a motherly little chicken duck thing who lost all of her little chick duckling things. Go get 'em, tiger. Except they can't move on their own. Not only can they not move on their own, they're apparently as heavy as stones of the same size, and they get eaten up at the touch of a gator or a bee, of which there are many in the odd enclosed spaces that you open doors to move between.

I guess you're thinking "just suspend disbelief here, seeing as there is 0 story obviously' no I can't really. Preceding the game, there's a slideshow that shows you just how all of the mother chicken duck lost all of her little chicklings: they ran away. Ugh no that. No.

On to more legitimate complaints.

####Controls

"Wow Aaron, you're going to complain about the controls?" Yeah, I am. The problem is that they're too good. Sounds stupid, but with tight controls and well built physics, the game waves its lost potential around your face every time you press a button.

This will make more sense in a bit.

####Puzzles and Level Design

This is it. This is the huge, glaring problem. Where do I start?

The 'levels' are framed by the border around the screen, and are marred by levels that are still too big for the screen space used by them. This is where the controls really just push the game deeper into the hole that it's in: each puzzle can be solved in the first second you spend looking at it, but you have to spend the rest of the time executing the level. However, the platforming bits of the puzzles aren't interesting or challenging, and whenever they are challenging
