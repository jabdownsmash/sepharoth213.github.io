####Sounds dumb.

It's not incredibly exciting but it's pretty novel. The original concept was Kevin's, I just put it into HaxePunk. In the process I ran into massive performance issues because I was creating entities for each section of the snake, which was not a good idea. There's also a lot of overdraw. When haxel is stronger I might port it over to that and maybe get a slicker game out of it.

It's on Kongregate [here](http://www.kongregate.com/games/aaronsantiago/chromacobra).
