####What is it?

It's a synthesizer/sequencer that is written completely in Python. It can do some stuff, it's all in these two videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNen0qSmvP8) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Q5yzpT2dQ).

####HackPrinceton?

It was a super cool 48 hour hackathon. They gave us food and everything, though they paid for our transportation using an incredibly stupid app called [Venmo](https://venmo.com/). At least they paid for it.

####Can I download it?

Why would you want to do that? You wouldn't. But [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/96l8v37nv531vlf/real-synthepyzer.zip) it is anyway. I think. I'll put it onto GitHub eventually.
