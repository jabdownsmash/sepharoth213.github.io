####Sounds like a dumb class.

Well it wasn't so bad. Mostly though it was within a semester so it wasn't particularly good or really very polished at all, but it was a finished product. The artist, Eliana Actor-Engel, did a great job with the art, however.

####Did you get an A?

Yeah of course. Come on.

####Alright, what about the game itself?

Stalin the Space Dog was born from Opi, the Facebook sticker. Basically we were strapped for ideas and I decided that we would simply throw together whatever ridiculous ideas we had into a pile of thoughts and assets and it became this game.
