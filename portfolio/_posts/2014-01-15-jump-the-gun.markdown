####What is it?

Here's the original [TIGForums post](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=17702), written by a much younger Aaron.

This was done in C++ using Allegro 5, and apparently at the time I had no idea how to get static linking to work because my oh my are the binaries a mess.

####How'd it do in the competition?

Awfully. The game was pretty bad, and really broken. Here, [take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zubmu9OQwc). At around 0:55, you can see the player/player collision freak out and they switch places, and immediately after, the red player teleports a bit upwards.

I definitely learned a lot, though.

####I want it!

If you can get it to run, be my guest. [Here you go](http://crossword-solver.googlecode.com/files/JumpTheGun.zip).
