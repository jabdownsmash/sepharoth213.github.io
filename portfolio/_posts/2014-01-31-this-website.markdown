####Sidebar

I spent most of the time of development on the sidebar, which was based off of the sidebar [here](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/simple-sidebar.html).

####Tools

It wasn't quite from scratch, I did use a bunch of frameworks:

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)  
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)  
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)  

####Source

The source is over on github
