####How'd ya do it

I spent most of the time of development on the sidebar, which was based off of the sidebar [here](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/simple-sidebar.html). The sidebar font is [Nunito](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Nunito).

Dynamically generating the recents dropdowns in liquid was really fun, and so was getting the cards system here and on the todo list.  
Writing all the content wasn't as fun.

####Technical stuff

It wasn't quite from scratch, I did use a bunch of frameworks:

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)  
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)  
[Bootstrap Magic](http://pikock.github.io/bootstrap-magic/index.html)  
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)  

The source is over on GitHub [here](https://github.com/sepharoth213/sepharoth213.github.io). The highlights are the dynamo and sidebar includes, which are the card system and the sidebar respectively.
